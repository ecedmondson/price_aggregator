# PR Review Policy #
####################

1) The author of the PR is never to merge their own PR. 
2) A PR must be approved in a review from at least two team members.
3) A PR must be merged by one of the reviewers who provided approval.
4) In special circumstances, more PR reviews may be requested.
5) When requesting changes, it is the responsibility of the reviewer
to assign the author of the PR back onto the PR after the review.
6) When implementing requested changes, it is the responsibility of
the author to re-assign the reviewer who requested changes after
implementing said changes.
7) It is the responsibility of the author to request reviews from
every team member when first submitting a PR.
7) If an author of a PR feels that their PR is ready to be merged
but the PR has received no reviews within a 24 hour period, the author
has the right to ping team members in our shared slack channel.
